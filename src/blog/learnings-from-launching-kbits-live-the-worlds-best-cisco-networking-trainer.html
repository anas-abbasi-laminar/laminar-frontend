                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Khawar, or KB as he insists on being called, has been teaching people how to become Cisco Networking experts for thirty-odd years.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Here's a pretty representative review:</p>
                                    <blockquote class="has-animation" data-delay="100">“Teaching Style — His explanations are EXCELLENT. He has a way of explaining the “why” of different concepts in a way that makes a light bulb go off over your heard.” - <a class="link" href="http://www.network-node.com/blog/2017/10/6/khawar-butts-ccie-security-v5-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Katherine McNamara</a></blockquote>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">When we spoke to him the first time earlier this year, we started to get a sense of the real tyranny of aggregation platforms like Youtube and Udemy.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">We learnt that world-beating content creators like KB are handing over their audiences, their content and between fifty and seventy percent of their revenue to folks who provide tech and reach.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">It's a pretty good set up.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">For folks who produce content that needs reach (think entertainers starting out), Youtube, and increasingly Twitch, makes a lot of sense. They get in front of a lot of people, become popular, and convert that popularity into money through a variety of means, some direct (buy my t-shirt) and other's less direct (buy their widget).</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Grown adults with money in their wallets are clearly willing to pay “hepta-CCIE and CCDE” KB money to learn. He doesn't need to sell t-shirts to them — okay, he should, I think t-shirts with bad networking puns on them are a great idea. But, you get the idea — he doesn't need to put his content out for free.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">As we continue to build out tomorrow's video-streaming infrastructure at Laminar, we realised KB was perfect for us to test out a key hypothesis — are people willing to pay him directly for online classes, or will they insist on going through a Udemy or Coursera?</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">We soft-launched <a class="link" href="https://kbits.live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">KBITS Live</a> four weeks ago (June 2020, O' traveller from the future), and he's already made more money since than in all the time he's been on Udemy.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Here are three key learnings:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li class="has-animation" data-delay="100"><p>The only thing standing in the way of a creator and revenue is the up-front cost of setting up world-class tech, so we gave KB our infrastructure at zero-cost. And we plan to do the same for any one who becomes our client.</p></li>
                                        <li class="has-animation" data-delay="100"><p>Creators don't mind sharing the wealth. Our simple promise — we make money when you make money — has helped both trust and revenue grow.</p></li>
                                        <li class="has-animation" data-delay="100"><p>Give a creator a platform they can monetize any which way they like and a little bit of support in building out marketing automation, and they (and their existing fans) will surprise you.</p></li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">We're doubling down on this: for anyone who wants to launch a subscriber led video streaming service (at any scale), we give you everything you need at zero upfront cost and an extraordinarily reasonable share of revenue OR a flat fee per paying user if you're going to get hundreds of thousands of subscribers :)</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">For the moment, we're sitting back and enjoying KB's success making light bulbs go off over people's heads.</p>
