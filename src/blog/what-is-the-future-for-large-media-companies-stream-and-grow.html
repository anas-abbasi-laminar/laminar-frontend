Strong relationships, built over decades are being upended because millennials are cutting the cord. They want to watch TV, but they do not want to flip channels or watch things when they are on. I am old enough to want to be cantankerous about it — but I want to tell you about the promised land I've discovered.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">You, the media company owner, never knew your viewer. Now, I know about the surveys and the immersions and everything else you did with a sample of your viewers, but you didn't know them. You knew your advertisers. But you didn't know your viewers. Your distribution partner barely knew them either — they didn't need to as long as someone paid the bill every month.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Streaming changes this, and how.</p>

You can get to know them intimately — not just who they are and where they're from, but what they like and dislike, what bores them, what captures their imagination and so much more.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">This treasure trove of data belongs to you and you can use this in so many ways: from picking content that works for niche audiences, to offering advertisers user segments that will have them salivating (and paying you a premium).</p>
