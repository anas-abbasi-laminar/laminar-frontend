                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Brands have shifted a growing share of their advertising to digital in the last ten years.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">In 2019, digital ad spends surpassed traditional media ad spends, according to an eMarketer report.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">And this gap is continuing to widen.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Digital ad spends are expected to reach 67.2% of total global ad expenditure, while traditional ad spends are expected to drop to 32.8% by 2025.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100"><strong>The last few years have seen a similar exciting trend â€” the tectonic shift of ad spends towards streaming services (and away from traditional TV).</strong></p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Connected TV ad spends in the US grew by 27% in 2020 while traditional TV declined by 17%, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">COVID-19 accelerated this shift but the trend has become permanent.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Connected TV ad spends increased by 31% in 2021 and 27% in 2022. While that of traditional TV declined by 7% in 2021 and 8% in 2022.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">That's huge!</p>
                                    <h4 class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Why the shift, though?</h4>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">There are many reasons for this dramatic shift, but two stand out.</p>
                                    <h5 class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Changing Viewer Habits</h5>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">There's an exponential increase in the adoption of streaming services by viewers who are rapidly moving away from traditional TV and towards on-demand, personalised content.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Between 2016 and 2021, traditional TV lost more than 50 million viewers, according to a report by eMarketer.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Traditional TV viewership peaked in 2013, and since then, consumers have flocked to connected TVs and streaming services.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">As a result, brands are finding it increasingly difficult to reach their target audiences through traditional TV advertising. This is because viewers are skipping ads, using DVRs to fast-forward through commercials, or simply not watching live TV at all.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">In contrast, streaming services provide brands with a much more targeted and engaged audience since they have access to detailed data on viewer demographics, viewing habits, and preferences. This allows brands to take data-led decisions such as targeting their ads to specific audiences or personalising their messaging based on viewer preferences etc.</p>
                                    <h5 class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Greater Cost Effectiveness</h5>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Brands can achieve a far superior ROI with ad spends on streaming services, simply because of the targeting & measurement capabilities and engaging ad formats available on them.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Thus brands can track, analyse, edit or pause their campaigns in real-time, which allows them to make data-led decisions and optimise their campaigns for better ROI.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100"><strong>A study by Roku and Magna Global found that ads on streaming services had a 67% higher ad recall than traditional TV ads. </strong></p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Additionally, the study found that streaming services had a 42% lower cost per thousand impressions (CPM) than traditional TV.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">This level of precision and accountability is not possible with traditional TV advertising, which often relies on estimates and projections rather than actual data.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Of course, that's not to say that traditional TV advertising is dead. Far from it, in fact. Ad spends on traditional TV are still huge numbers. But they're going south. And fast.</p>
                                    <h4 class="has-animation" data-delay="100">What does this mean for media companies?</h4>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Broadcasting technology is outdated, and cannot meet the demands of modern audiences cutting the cord and brands diverting ad spends from traditional TV.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Streaming services on the other hand need to get their tech act in order to take advantage of this shift. </p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">That is why we exist.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Media companies have to worry only and only about creating content and delighting audiences. And we take care of everything else.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">From state-of-the-art technology infrastructure to seamless content delivery, from painless licensing management to always available technical support, from ever-expanding distribution (30+ apps and 180 countries) to effortless tax management â€” we literally take care of everything.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">And, that too in a matter of weeks.</p>
