                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">We at Laminar are always excited to bring you the latest updates and innovations that make streaming simpler and more accessible for your viewers. Today, we're thrilled to introduce you to something that'll help you reach every corner of the digital world — Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">In our ongoing quest to empower content owners and media companies, we're constantly seeking ways to enhance the streaming experience. Our recent update, <strong>[WebClient] Release 1.2.39</strong>, brings PWAs into the spotlight. But why is this such a game-changer? Let's dive in.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">PWAs, in a nutshell, are your ticket to reaching every corner of the globe, even in regions where mid-range and low-end smartphones are the norm. These nifty web-based apps break down the barriers that traditional native apps often face, such as compatibility issues and memory constraints.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">According to the latest statistics, the number of global smartphone users is estimated to reach a staggering <a class="link" href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/how-many-people-have-smartphones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>5.25 billion</strong></a> in 2023. That's a whopping 98% increase compared to 2016. However, the majority of these users are rocking mid-range or budget smartphones, especially in emerging economies and areas with limited internet bandwidth. This is where PWAs shine.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">So, what does this mean for you? It means that with PWAs, you can tap into this massive audience from day one. No longer will you face issues like native video player quirks, storage problems, or frustrating crashes due to memory limitations. PWAs deliver a seamless streaming experience, irrespective of the device in your viewers' hands.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">In places like tier 2 and tier 3 cities of India, Africa, and emerging economies across the world, where mid-range and low-end smartphones are the norm, PWAs become a game-changer. These devices often come with memory restrictions, limiting the number of apps users can install, and may lack full DRM and playback compatibility.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">This is where PWA circumvents these issues and immediately opens the doors to include a large populace into your streaming service reach. PWAs provide a seamless streaming experience on these budget-friendly devices, offering smooth playback and eliminating storage concerns. It allows you to tap into an audience far larger than those with smart TVs or flagship phones, and you can do this from day one, without the hassle of publishing apps on app stores or convincing users to install them.</p>
                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">At Laminar, we've always prided ourselves on offering a comprehensive video streaming solution.

                                    <p class="has-animation" data-delay="100">Our mission at Laminar is clear: to enable content creators and media companies to focus on what they do best — creating engaging content.
